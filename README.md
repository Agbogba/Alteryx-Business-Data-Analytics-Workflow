This project covers different Alteryx Designer Workflow in order to respond to Business needs:  

* The file "challenge_120_start_file.yxmd" contains a workflow throught which I determine the most popular names for Males and Females babies that were registered between the years of 1880 and 2017 for each available year.

* The file "challenge_1_start_file.yxmd" contains a workflow throught which I blended two data sets: one conraining Customer Records with a series of postal codes and another containing postcode ranges.

* The file "challenge_2_start_file.yxmd" contains a workflow that prepare delimited data by removing quotes and double quotes. For this I used the following Tools:
  * Text To Columns Tool to separate data by commas into columns, 
  * Formula Tool to strip quotes within columns,
  * DateTime Tool to reformat DateTime data,
  * Select Tool to rename columns, resize data types and choose appropriate columns for the output data,
  * Browse Tool to view the output data
