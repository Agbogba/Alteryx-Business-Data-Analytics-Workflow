This project covers different Alteryx Designer Workflow in order to respond to Business needs:  

* The file "challenge_120_start_file.yxmd" contains a workflow throught which I determine the most popular names for Males and Females babies that were registered between the years of 1880 and 2017 for each available year.

* The file "challenge_1_start_file.yxmd" contains a workflow throught which I blended two data sets: one conraining Customer Records with a series of postal codes and another containing postcode ranges.
